About pyqi
----------

pyqi (canonically pronounced *pie chee*) is designed to support wrapping general commands in multiple types of interfaces, including at the command line, HTML, and API levels. We're currently in the early stages of development, and there is a lot to be done. We're very interested in having beta users, and we fully embrace collaborative development, so if you're interested in using or developing pyqi, you should get in touch.

pyqi's only requirement is a working Python 2.7 installation.

Getting involved in development
-------------------------------

pyqi is open source software, available under the BSD license.

Development is primarily occurring in the [Caporaso](www.caporaso.us) and [Knight](https://knightlab.colorado.edu/) labs (at Northern Arizona University and University of Colorado, respectively), but the goal is for this to be a very open development effort. We accept code submissions as [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

All source code is hosted in the `pyqi GitHub repository <https://github.com/bipy/pyqi/>`_.
