Installing qcli
===============

qcli has no dependencies outside of Python, so installing is easy. 

1. Download the latest version of qcli from our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/bipy/qcli>`_. You can do this by downloading the zip file linked from that page, or with ``git clone`` for ``git`` users. If you download as a zip, uncompress the downloaded file. Currently we do not create releases of qcli, as the ``master`` branch is designed to always be release-quality code, so you should just always work with the head of the master branch.
2. Change to the qcli directory with ``cd qcli`` (this will be called ``qcli-master`` if you downloaded and uncompressed the zip file, so you'd change to that directory with ``cd qcli-master``).
3. Run ``python setup.py install``.

That's it!
