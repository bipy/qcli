Installing pyqi
===============

pyqi has no dependencies outside of Python, so installing is easy.

* First, decide if you want to work with the release or development version of pyqi. If you work with the release version, you'll have the most recent stable version of pyqi, but may not have access to the latest and greatest features. If you're most interested in having access to the latest features and can tolerate some instability, you should work with the development version of pyqi. If you're unsure about what you want here, you should likely work with the release version.

 * To use the release version of pyqi, you can download it from `here <NEED LINK!!>`_. The latest release is pyqi 0.2.0. After downloading, unzip the file with ``tar -xzf pyqi-0.2.0.tgz`` and change to the new ``pyqi-0.2.0`` directory.
 * To use the latest development version of pyqi you can download it from our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/bipy/pyqi>`_ using ``git clone git@github.com:bipy/pyqi.git``. After downloading, change to the new ``pyqi`` directory.

* Next, run ``python setup.py install``. That's it!
