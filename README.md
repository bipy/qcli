qcli 
====

Tools for developing and testing command line interfaces in Python. 

qcli (canonically pronounced *queue sea el eye*) is being designed to make [QIIME](www.qiime.org)'s Command Line Interface framework a standalone package so it can be used in tools other than QIIME without the very heavy-weight dependency of QIIME itself. The name of this package may change as it reaches maturity.

Development will primarily occur in the [Caporaso](www.caporaso.us) and [Knight](https://knightlab.colorado.edu/) labs (at Northern Arizona University and University of Colorado, respectively), but the goal is for this to be a very open development effort. We accept code submissions as pull requests.

For now, you should direct questions to gregcaporaso@gmail.com.
