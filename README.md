qcli (Qiime's Command Line Interface framework)
===============================================

Tools for developing and testing command line interfaces in Python. 

The qcli package is being designed to make [QIIME](www.qiime.org)'s command line interface framework a standalone package, as it is becoming apparent that it will be useful in tools other than QIIME, and QIIME itself is a very heavy-weight dependency. The name of this package may change as it reaches maturity.

Development will primarily occur in the [Caporaso](www.caporaso.us) and [Knight](https://knightlab.colorado.edu/) labs (at Northern Arizona University and University of Colorado, respectively), but the goal is for this to be a very open development effort. We accept code submissions as pull requests.

For now, you should direct questions to gregcaporaso@gmail.com.
